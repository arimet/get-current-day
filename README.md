[![Daily Version Update](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-daily-blue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-current-day)

A completely useless NPM package that does just one thing: returns today's date.  
It gets a **new version every single day**, because... why not? 🤷‍♂️  

## 🚀 Installation

```sh
npm install get-current-day
```

or  

```sh
yarn add get-current-day
```

## 📌 Usage

```js
import today from 'get-current-day';

console.log(today()); // "YYYY-MM-DD"
```

That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

## 🔄 Automatic Daily Updates

Every day, a GitHub Action updates the package version to match the current date (`YYYY.MM.DD`).  
If you want to stay up-to-date with **the latest version of today**, just keep updating the package daily:

```sh
npm update get-current-day
```

## 🎉 Why does this exist?
- Because we can.
- Because daily package updates are fun.
- Because **"what even is time?"**
